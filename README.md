# Project Title

## Description

This project focuses on a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that includes data cleaning, normalization, and classification. The primary goal is to prepare a set of raw data for machine learning tasks, ensuring that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for model training and testing.

### Key Components

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Identifying and handling missing values.
   - Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
   - Correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Scaling numerical features to a standard range.
   - Transforming categorical data into a usable format for machine learning models.

3. **Training and Testing**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Utilizing various classification algorithms to train the model.
   - Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
